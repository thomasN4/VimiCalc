# KeyCommand Manual Test Plan

Run the app with `./gradlew run` and perform each test from a fresh launch
(or press `u` repeatedly to undo back to a clean state).

Legend:
- Keys in `backticks` are pressed sequentially, one at a time
- "cell A1" means column A, row 1 (top-left)
- "info bar" is the bar at the bottom showing cell content / messages

### 5.2 Redo
1. After undoing (5.1), press `r` — A1 shows "first" again

### 5.3 Undo at limit
1. Fresh launch, press `u` — info bar shows "Already at earliest change."

### 5.4 Redo at limit
1. Fresh launch, press `r` — info bar shows "Already at latest change."

### 5.5 Undo a merge (compound step, issue #77)
1. Enter "top" in A1 and "mid" in B1
2. At A1, press `v` `l` `j` `m` — A1:B2 merge into one block, "mid" disappears
3. Press `u` — the merge dissolves and **both** "top" and "mid" are back
4. Press `r` — the block is merged again, "mid" is blanked again

### 5.6 Undo an unmerge
1. Merge A1:B2 as in 5.5
2. Press `m` — the block unmerges
3. Press `u` — the merge is restored (moving into any cell of the range
   pulls the cursor to A1)
4. Press `u` again — steps back over the original merge as well

### 5.7 Undo a VISUAL-mode delete (one step)
1. Enter "a" in A1, "b" in B1, "c" in A2
2. At A1, press `v` `l` `j` `d`, then Escape — all cells in the block clear
3. Press `u` once — all three values return together
4. Press `r` — the whole block clears again

### 5.8 Merged block keeps all four border gridlines (issue #77)
1. Go to B5 (`g` `B` `5` `l`, then `h` back), press `v`, extend to E10, press `m`
2. Move the cursor off the block — **all four** border gridlines of the
   merged block are visible (top and left included), while the gridlines
   *inside* the block are gone
3. Scroll around (e.g. `20j` then `20k`) and re-check — the borders persist
   across repaints

---

## 6. Go-to (g{coords})

### 6.1 Go to a cell
1. Press `g` `A` `3` — nothing happens yet (waiting for a trailing key)
2. Press `h` — cursor jumps to A3, then the `h` executes (moves left to... stays at column A)
3. Alternatively: `g` `C` `5` `l` — jumps to C5 then moves right to D5

### 6.2 Go to and jump back (Ctrl-O)
1. At A1, press `g` `C` `5` `l` — cursor jumps to C5 then moves to D5
2. Press Ctrl-O — cursor jumps back to A1

---

## 7. Macros (q{letter}, @{letter}, .)

### 7.1 Record and play a macro
1. Press `q` `a` — info bar shows "Recording macro 'a' ..."
2. Press `i`, type "macro", press Escape, press `j`
3. Press `q` — info bar shows "Macro recorded"
4. Press `@` `a` — the cell below should now contain "macro", cursor moves down

### 7.2 Repeat last editing command (.)
Note: `.` replays the last *editing* expression (`dd`, `yy`, `yd`, `pp`, `m`,
macro replays). Movement keys, undo/redo, and mode switches do not overwrite
it — Vim-like behavior, per issue #24.

1. Enter "one" into A1 and "two" into A2
2. At A1, press `d` `d` — A1 is deleted
3. Press `j` — moves to A2
4. Press `.` — A2 is deleted (replays `dd`, not `j`)

### 7.3 Dot ignores movement-only presses
1. At A1, press `3` `j` — moves to A4
2. Press `.` — nothing moves (movement never enters the dot register;
   if an edit was made earlier in the session, that edit repeats instead)

### 7.4 Paced playback (:macroDelay)
1. Record a macro: `q` `a`, then `i`, type "x", Escape, `j`, then `q`
2. Press `;` and run `macroDelay 200`
3. Press `3` `@` `a` — the three cells fill in visibly one step at a time
   (about one keystroke every 200ms), not all at once
4. While it plays, press `l` or type letters — they are ignored (the cursor
   only moves as the macro dictates)
5. Press `;` and run `macroDelay` (no argument), then `3` `@` `a` — the
   replay is instant again

### 7.5 Abort paced playback with ESC
1. With the macro from 7.4 recorded, run `macroDelay 500`
2. Press `9` `@` `a`, then press Escape mid-replay — playback stops,
   info bar shows "Macro playback aborted.", remaining steps never run
3. Press `j` — normal input works again immediately

### 7.6 Recording is not polluted by paced replay
1. Run `macroDelay 200`
2. Record `q` `b`, press `@` `a`, wait for it to finish, press `l`, press `q`
3. Press `@` `b` — it performs macro a's steps then moves right, i.e. the
   replayed events were recorded once as `@a` (not expanded), and nothing
   was double-recorded

### 7.7 Recording indicator chip
1. Press `j`, `l`, `v`, Escape — the header-corner chip never appears and
   never shows a key name
2. Record a small macro into register `x` (as in 7.1) for use in step 5
3. Press `q` `a` — a red chip showing "● a" appears over the header corner
4. Press `i`, type "text", press Escape, press `j`, press `v`, press Escape —
   the chip stays visible with "● a" through every mode change
5. Press `@` `x` while still recording — the chip does not flicker or hide
   during the replay
6. Press `q` — info bar shows "Macro recorded" and the chip disappears

---

## 8. Quit shortcuts (ZZ, ZQ)

### 8.1 Save and quit
1. Press `Z` `Z` — app saves and exits

### 8.2 Quit without saving
1. Press `Z` `Q` — app exits without saving

### 8.3 Invalid Z command
1. Press `Z` `x` — should reset expression, nothing happens

---

## 9. Range paste (p{n}{dir})

### 9.1 Paste across a range
1. Enter "val" into A1, yank it with `y` `y`
2. Navigate to B1
3. Press `p` `3` `j` — B1, B2, B3, B4 should all contain "val"

---

## 10. Invalid / Incomplete Commands (Expression Reset)

### 10.1 Invalid second char for yank
1. Press `y` `x` — info bar shows "Invalid command: yx", expression resets
2. You can immediately type a new command

### 10.2 Invalid second char for delete
1. Press `d` `x` — info bar shows "Invalid command: dx", expression resets
   (note: `d` + movement key is a valid range-op, e.g. `d` `l` deletes rightward)

### 10.3 Invalid second char for paste
1. Press `p` `x` — info bar shows "Invalid command: px", expression resets
   (note: `p` + movement key is a valid range-op, e.g. `p` `j` pastes downward)

### 10.4 Ctrl-C to cancel partial input
1. Type `y` (expression shows "y" in info bar, waiting for second char)
2. Press Ctrl-C — expression clears

### 10.5 Entering COMMAND mode to escape
1. Type `y` (expression waiting for second char)
2. Press `;` — enters COMMAND mode, expression resets

---

## 11. Zoom (Ctrl+=, Ctrl+-, Ctrl+0, :zoom)

### 11.1 Zoom in / out / reset with keys
1. Press Ctrl+`=` three times — cells, their text, and the row/column header
   labels all grow together; the status/info bars stay their normal size;
   info bar shows "Zoom: 133%"
2. Press Ctrl+`-` once — one step back down, info bar shows "Zoom: 121%"
3. Press Ctrl+`0` — layout returns exactly to the original size,
   info bar shows "Zoom: 100%"

### 11.2 Un-modified keys keep their meaning
1. Press `=` (no Ctrl) — enters FORMULA mode as usual; press Escape
2. Press `1` `0` `j` — cursor moves down 10 cells (the `0` still works
   as a multiplier digit); the view does not zoom

### 11.3 :zoom command
1. Press `;` then type `zoom 200` and press Enter — cells double in size
2. Press `;` then type `zoom` (no argument) and press Enter — back to 100%
3. Press `;` then type `zoom 10` and press Enter — info bar shows the error
   "zoom expects a percentage between 25 and 400."

### 11.4 Zoom interacts with scroll and resized cells
1. Navigate far from the origin (e.g. `g` T40) so the view is scrolled
2. Press Ctrl+`=` a few times — the cursor stays visible (the view
   auto-scrolls if the zoomed cell would fall off the edge)
3. Press Ctrl+`0`, then on some column run `;` `resCol 40` Enter
4. Press Ctrl+`=` — the widened column grows proportionally
   (stays wider than its neighbors); Ctrl+`0` restores it to exactly
   default + 40 pixels

### 11.5 Zoom with merged cells
1. Select a block in VISUAL mode (`v`, move, `m`) to merge it
2. Press Ctrl+`=` — the merged block scales as one region and its
   text scales with it

## 12. Command-name completion (TAB in COMMAND mode)

### 12.1 Cycle through matches
1. Press `;` then type `res` and press Tab — command line reads `:resCol`,
   the right side of the info bar shows `[resCol]  resRow`
2. Press Tab again — command line reads `:resRow`, brackets move to `resRow`
3. Press Tab again — the typed prefix `res` is restored
4. Press Shift+Tab — cycles backwards (to `resRow`)

### 12.2 Session ends on other keys
1. Press `;`, type `font`, press Tab (→ `fontSize`), then type ` 18`
   and press Enter — the current cell's font size changes; the candidate
   list disappears
2. Press `;`, type `x`, press Tab — the right side of the info bar shows
   "No matching command", command line keeps `:x`
3. Press `;`, press Tab with nothing typed — cycles through every command;
   press Escape — back to NORMAL mode with no command run

### 12.3 No completion for VISUAL-mode formulas or arguments
1. Select cells in VISUAL mode, press `;`, type a formula and press Tab —
   nothing is completed and no tab character is inserted
2. Press `;`, type `cellColor r`, press Tab — nothing changes (completion
   only applies before the first space)

## 13. Command-line caret (COMMAND mode, issue #83)

### 13.1 Caret visible and blinking
1. Press `;` — the info bar shows `:` with a thin caret after it, blinking
   at a steady rate; the caret spans the text's line height (it does not
   poke above the tops of tall letters like `l` or below descenders)
2. Type `write` slowly — the caret sits right after the last typed character
   and restarts solid (visible) on every keystroke
3. Press Escape — back to NORMAL mode, the caret disappears

### 13.2 Mid-line insert and delete
1. Press `;`, type `wrte`, then press Ctrl+`b` twice — the caret sits
   between `wr` and `te`; the text is unchanged, and the letters do not
   shift horizontally as the caret passes over them
2. Type `i` — the line reads `:write` with the caret after the `i`;
   the text on both sides of the caret stayed in place
3. Press Backspace — the `i` is removed again (`:wrte`), caret between
   `wr` and `te`
4. Press Ctrl+`d` — the `t` under the caret is removed (`:wre`),
   caret stays put; press Escape

### 13.3 Errors hide the caret
1. Press `;`, type `nosuchcommand`, press Enter — the info bar shows the
   error message with no caret and no blinking
2. Press `;`, press Backspace on the empty line — "COMMAND IS EMPTY" shows;
   typing afterwards brings the command line and caret back

### 13.4 Emacs-style line editing
1. Press `;`, type `cellColor red`
2. Press Ctrl+`a` — caret jumps to just after the `:`; Ctrl+`e` — back to
   the end; Home/End behave the same
3. Press Alt+`b` twice — caret jumps to the start of `red`, then to the
   start of `cellColor`; Alt+`f` moves word-wise forward again
4. With the caret at the start of ` red`, press Ctrl+`k` — the rest of the
   line is deleted (`:cellColor`)
5. Type ` blue`, press Ctrl+`a`, then Alt+`d` — the word `cellColor` is
   deleted, leaving `: blue`; press Escape
6. Left/Right arrows move the caret by one character (they do not leave
   COMMAND mode, unlike in INSERT mode)
